# DTC Virtual Screening Practical

This github repo contains materials needed for the DTC Virtual Screening Practical on Tuesday 30th November 2021. The morning activities focus on using GOLD for protein-ligand docking and conducting a virtual screening exercise. In the afternoon we will use a couple of different generative models for fragment elaboration.
